# Deep_Learning



This repository contains my slight modifications to the lab "Building Your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step" from the course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", 
part of the Deep Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. The changes were made to deepen my understanding and explore the use of tensor notation 
in deriving the equations for constructing a neural network.

I adapted the code to use TensorFlow, while preserving the original structure and logic of the original file of the course.
