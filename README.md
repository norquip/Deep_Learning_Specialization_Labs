This repository contains my notes on some of the subjects and  slight modifications to the programming assignments from [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
The changes were made to deepen my understanding. 


##  Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
"Building Your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step" from the course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", 
part of the Deep Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. The changes were made to deepen my understanding and explore the use of tensor notation 
in deriving the equations for constructing a neural network.

I adapted the code to use TensorFlow, while preserving the original structure and logic of the original file of the course.
