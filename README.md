# Deep Learning Specialization — Notes & Modifications

⚠️ This repository is currently under construction.



This repository contains some of my personal notes on several topics of the courses, along with slight modifications to some of
the programming assignments from the [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
These changes were made to deepen my understanding and explore alternative approaches.




##  Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This first course covers the fundamental concepts of neural networks and deep learning. I learned the vectorization method, an efficient technique for deriving the forward and backward propagation equations, as well as for processing data across the neural network.
In addition, I learned how to use NumPy to perform all the computations in the code.


*  Week 4 - programming assignment: *Building Your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step*.
  
   Being accustomed to work with tensors, I wondered whether tensor notation could be used instead of vectorization notation to derive the equations, and how tensors could be implemented in the code. After some exploration, I decided to work with *TensorFlow*. 
   Here, I adapted the code of the assignment to the  *TensorFlow* syntax while preserving the original structure and logic of the original file of the course. No figures are included.
