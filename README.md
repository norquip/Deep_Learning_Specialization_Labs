# Deep Learning Specialization â€” Notes & Modifications

This repository contains some of my personal notes on several topics of the courses, along with slight modifications to some of
the programming assignments from the [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
These changes were made to deepen my understanding and explore alternative approaches.




##  Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This first course covers the fundamental concepts of neural networks and deep learning. I learned the vectorization method, an efficient technique for deriving the forward and backward propagation equations, as well as for processing data across the neural network.
In addition, I learned how to use NumPy to perform all the computations in the code.

Being accustomed to work with tensors, I wondered whether tensor notation could be used instead of vectorization notation to derive these equations, and how tensors could be implemented in code. After some exploration, I decided to work with TensorFlow. To explore this, I made slight modifications to the Week 4 programming assignment, *Building Your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step*. My goals were to deepen my understanding and investigate how tensor notation could be applied  in this assignment. 
I adapted the code to use TensorFlow, while preserving the original structure and logic of the original file of the course.
